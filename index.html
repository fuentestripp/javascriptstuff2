            <p class="reasoning">Alex Smith, though injured, is the greatest
              quarterback I have ever seen. Ever been made fun of? Told you were

              better? Have you ever had to be the scapegoat for everyone else's failures?
               Alex Smith has done all of this. He was the face of San Francisco despite
